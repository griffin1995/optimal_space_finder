FOR '20' IT PUT IT ON A SPOT THATS NOT POSSIBLE, REVISE SO THAT IT CAN ONLY PICK / ONLY CHECKS POSSIBLE SPOTS
AT THE END OUTPUT A GRAPH THAT SHOWS ALL OPTIMAL LOCATIONS FOR EACH POTENTIAL RADIUS ON THE SAME GRAPH
DOUBLE CHECK THE PATH FINDING IS CORRECT
MANUALLY CHECK ALL DISTANCES IN GAME
REVISE GRAPH SO IT SAYS THE RADIUS IN TITLE FOR EACH ONE
IN GAME SHORTEST PATH SHOWS SHORTEST # TILES TO GET TO DESTINATION - SHOULD BE USING THAT ALGORITHM / AKA HOW MANY TILES AWAY IS SPAWN, INSTEAD OF A RADIUS, AS CIRCLE RADIUS ISNT TILES
REVISE THE GRAPHS SO IT SAYS THE ACTUAL X/Y FOR TILES AKA (3726,10279)


MANUAL DISTANCES CHECKED: 5,6,
